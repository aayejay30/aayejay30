## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, This is Adrian James

Hey, I'm Adrian, a Business Intelligence Analysis student at TripleTen. I have been parcipating in TripleTen bootcamp for several weeks. I am in the last sprint of the bootcamp. In the bootcamp, I've learned Spreadsheet Data Analysis, SQL, Business Analytics, Tableau and Power BI. 

I am currently job searching for Business Analysis for any company, just looking for the experience. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my final project for TripleTen and creating my career portfolio. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m recently learned about Power BI and Tableau, discovering the differences between the two.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate more on Javascript, SQL, and Phython with my experience of HTML. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Power BI and Tableau, with the coding portion of what table or sheet goes into the brackets.
